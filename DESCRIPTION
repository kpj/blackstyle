Description: A tidy code style building on the tidyverse code
    style guidelines but with a small changes for consistent line breaks
    and indentation. Enforces line breaks, if there are any initially
    between arguments in function calls and left-indents arguments in
    function definitions. In addition, contains changes to make
    formatter behave more like Python's black.
